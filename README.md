# An-Image-processing-based-digital-scarecrow
This is image proceesing approach for detecting the scarecrow and find the motion of the scarecrow.
Orchard fruits and vegetable crops are vulnerable to wild birds and animals. These wild birds and animals can cause critical damage to the produce. Traditional methods of scaring away birds such as scarecrows are one of the solutions. Image processing methods can be effectively applied to detecting items with motion detection in video footage or taking snaps. The proposed system has been simulated in MATLAB software.

The system is able to detect and track the pest birds from the real time video frame and from images.
After the object is detected an alarm will raise as notification.
The system can detect the bird with motion. 
The approach can implement in agricultural sector.
Image processing approach can detect the guest birds and also can give the particular bird’s information. 

Fruits and vegetable crops are vulnerable to wild birds. These wild birds can cause critical damage to the produces. Image processing approach could detect the wild birds and later people can take some steps for solving it.

We can process bird’s image and make a data that, which birds are mostly useful for telling us about the ecosystem function.

 Another aim is to detect a bird appearing at some time in a short video sequence where some flying squirrel, flying fish, bat are also present. Image processing of the snap can provide a detecting a bird’s present.
